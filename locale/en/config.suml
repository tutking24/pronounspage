            Some people prefer not using any pronouns, instead being referred by name, initial,
            omitting pronouns with passive voice, or restructuring the sentence.

            quote: >
                Communication is a powerful tool. It is a vehicle for moulding our attitudes, perceptions and behaviour, and
                reflects the world in which we aspire to live and work.
                Words and pictures therefore matter, because communication can become discriminatory if we fail to consider
                the assumptions which influence the language and visuals we use.
                Language is always changing: words evolve and how we use them should evolve in tandem. Using gender-neutral
                and bias-free language is a way of moving away from outdated perceptions about men, women, persons with
                disabilities and other groups of people in society.
