The creators of this Work (‚ÄúThe Licensor‚Äù) grant permission

and indicate whether and what kind of changes were made.
The User may do so in any reasonable manner,

## Prohibitions

No one may use this Work for prejudiced or bigoted purposes, including but not limited to:
racism, xenophobia, queerphobia, queer exclusionism, homophobia, transphobia, enbyphobia, misogyny.

No one may use this Work to inflict or facilitate violence or abuse of human rights as defined in the

may use the Work for any reason.

No private business run for profit with more than a thousand employees
may use the Work for any reason.

Unless the User has made substantial changes to the Work,

they are prohibited from selling the Work.
That prohibition includes processing the Work with machine learning models.
