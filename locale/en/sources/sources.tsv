distress	Book	Greg ^Egan	Distress		1995	Every journalist paraphrased vis subjects (p. 19)@Ve was dressed in black jeans and a loose black T-shirt. (p. 95)@Science and technology seemed to have given ver everything ve could ask for (p. 194)@Kuwale hesitated and cast vis eyes down. (p. 195)@I could hear ver breathing slowly, trying to calm verself (p. 227)	The pronouns are used with reference to “asex” characters (it's a sci-fi novel in which some people rid themselves of sex characteristics and sexuality as a, sort of, political/philosophical manifesto) and generically (instead of, e.g. singular “they”).		01EP5KZNBCCAD2024012HFMCR3
differentlyAnimated	Book	K. A. ^Cook	The Differently Animated and Queer Society	A short story from a collection called “Crooked Words” by K. A. Cook	2013	Pat couldn’t help a slight frown as ze got out of hir car. It wasn’t likely that someone was going to try and mug a zombie, but even so, the neighbourhood didn’t seem all that prosperous. There weren’t even too many cars around, just one down the other end of the street and a rusty bike chained to a light post.|Maybe ze shouldn’t have waited until ze’d be the last to arrive. What if everyone had come, decided that nobody was coming, and gone home already? What if ze was the only one to come at all?@This will be fine, Pat told hirself, in what felt like a ridiculous attempt to bolster hir courage. If ze had summoned up the courage for hir last job interview—and Pat thought ze would have gotten it despite being undead if ze felt remotely inclined to try and pass, something that annoyed hir job seeker support officer no end—then ze could summon up the courage to do this. This should be easier than a job interview!			01EP5KZNBCCAD2024012HFMCR3
prefaceTo	Book	Susan ^Stryker, Stephen Whittle	Preface to a reprint of Leslie Feinberg's pamphlet in “The Transgender Studies Reader”		2006	Leslie Feinberg, whose particular style of being transgender helped non-gender-specific pronouns like “s/he” and “hir” achieve a limited popularity over the past decade, must be considered a founding f gure of contemporary transgender studies. Hir influential pamphlet, reproduced below, took an older (and apolitical) term — transgender — and infused it with a radical new meaning. (p. 205)@Though hir particular theory of history has not attracted widespread support in transgender communities, hir work has gained a devoted and grateful following for the powerful way it calls upon transgender people to recover their historical legacy, and to harness that knowledge to the current struggle for a more just society.

buckingThe	Article	Levi C. R. ^Hord	Bucking the Linguistic Binary: Gender Neutral Language in English, Swedish, French, and German	Proceedings of Western Interdisciplinary Student Symposium on Language Research, Iss. 1, Vol. 3	2016	Speaking from hir unique gender position, Feinberg highlighted what ze called a “crisis of language” (Owen 1996) which often results in clumsy dual constructions such as s/he, and which would be solved by abandoning binary language altogether in favour of specific language to suit complex gender identities.

deGrassiNext	Series		DeGrassi: Next Class	Season 4, Episode 6 “#FactsOnly”	2017	My favorite vlogger did a thing about this. They identify as genderqueer. Or, I think there’s another name for it. Um... Genderfluid. They feel like they’re between a boy or a girl. Or both. Or neither.			01EP5KZNBCCAD2024012HFMCR3
theJoy	Book	Michael D. ^Spivak	The Joy of TeX. A Gourmet Guide to Typesetting with the AMS-TeX Macro Package	The quotes are from the 2nd edition (2004 reprint), the original was published in 1982	2004	Just as ‘I’ is the first person singular pronoun, regardless of gender, so ‘E’ will be used in this book as the third person singular pronoun for both genders. Thus, ‘E’ is the singular of ‘they’. Accordingly, ‘Eir’ (pronounced to rhyme with ‘their’) will be the possessive, and ‘Em’ (rhyming with ‘them’) will stand for either ‘him’ or ‘her’. Here is an example that illustrates all three forms: E loves Em only for Eir body. (p. xv)@If a book designer wanted to use underlining extensively, E would have to design a special ‘\ul’ font in which each letter has an underline as part of it; of course, the letters g, j, p, q and y would be one of Eir design problems. (p. 18)@If the author uses such notation, it should be up to Em to indicate Eir intentions clearly, but there’s no harm checking first. (p. 63)	1) Note the capitalization of the pronoun. 2) Spivak doesn't provide a reflexive form.		01EP5KZNBCCAD2024012HFMCR3

arcaIs	Article	Patric ^Fallon	Arca Is the Artist of the Decade	Vice	2019	The Venezuela-born artist, who came out as non-binary in 2018 and uses the pronouns "she" and "it," has come to embody practically every positive thing that is synonymous with the 2010s.		https://www.vice.com/en/article/evj9k4/arca-is-the-artist-of-the-decade	01EQRH10C3W5M9W7712204Y17B
steelBreeze	Book	Alastair ^Reynolds	On The Steel Breeze		2013	Travertine’s a pretty divisive figure. Ve’s a friend of mine – or was, I suppose. When ve was last in trouble, I was one of those who pushed for a lighter punishment. The issue split the assembly – Sou-Chun was among those who felt we needed to make a clearer example of ver, if only to keep the rest of the local caravan happy.@You spoke to Travertine yesterday, when ve came to your house. How would you describe vis state of mind?@So Travertine had set verself on this path, constantly testing Assembly authority, chafing against restrictions, pushing vis luck. After the last censure, ve had done well to avoid imprisonment. But Travertine always rebuilt and pushed further. And Chiku had to agree with ver here – the Assembly always knew what Travertine was up to and chose not to intervene. Because on some unspoken level they wanted ver to succeed.			01EP5KZNBCCAD2024012HFMCR3

Eir silken hair, cut evenly at the chin, shone as it moved. Although difficult to guess eir ethnic origin and not exactly beautiful, ey had strangely magnetic eyes. “My name is Tei,” ey said.@One of the Rounds, panic-stricken at the thought of being hit, began to run, pushing and shoving the others around em.@But Fortia twisted free from his grasp and threw emself against the terminal.			01EP5KZNBCCAD2024012HFMCR3
