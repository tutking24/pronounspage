name	pronouns	description
Normative forms	he,she	It's worth mentioning that pronouns ≠ gender. One can still be nonbinary while using pronouns that are congruent with (or opposite to) their gender assigned at birth.
Normative-ish forms	they,it,one	Those pronouns have been in common use in normative English already, but recently they got a slightly different new usage: describing a single, specific person.
Neopronouns	e	Unlike the other pronouns, which are officially recognised as “grammatically correct”, albeit used in a different meaning than we're used to, neopronouns are novel. Not being included in dictionaries doesn't make them any worse, though!
Interchangeable forms	he&she,he&they,she&they	Many nonbinary people use more than one form interchangably and are fine with being called either of them.
