Normative Pronomen	sie,er	It's worth mentioning that pronouns ≠ gender. One can still be nonbinary while using pronouns that are congruent with (or opposite to) their gender assigned at birth.
Neutrum	es	Those pronouns have been in common use in normative German already, but usually not for describing a person. But remember that the “es” pronoun has a history of transphobic use, so only use it with people who explicitly wish it.
Neopronomen	dey,die,el,em,en,et,ey,hän,hen,iks,ind,per,ser,sier,they,xier,zet,ersie	Unlike the other pronouns, which are officially recognised as “grammatically correct”, albeit used in a different meaning than we're used to, neopronouns are novel. Not being included in dictionaries doesn't make them any worse, though! Some neoprouns' names are derived from the names of their creators.
Grafische Pronomen	er:sie,er*sie,er_sie	These pronouns use special typographic characters that are not necessarily meant to be pronounced literally.
