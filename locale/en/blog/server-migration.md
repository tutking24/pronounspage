When it comes to [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), I'm just the “dev”.
I write code, but I'd rather have someone else worry about making sure it keeps running as intended.
I manage my personal VPS, I manage some servers at work, but I wouldn't call myself an expert in that area at all.
So I'm super proud of myself and how well it went when I migrated a big project to a new machine 😊
The downtime was just 15 minutes! Here's the story, if you're interested.
