# Small change to Terms of Service – explicit ban of ableism

<small>2023-03-06 | [@andrea](/@andrea)</small>

On our website we've never been allowing “Content that might break the law or violate social norms”.
It's a pretty broad rule, but we also provide a (non-exhaustive) list of examples of content that we consider harmful.
Ableist speech was missing from that list, but now it will be explicitly enumerated.

The following wording (in bold) will come into effect on April 4th, 2023:

> It is forbidden to post on the Service any Content that might break the law or violate social norms,
> including but not limited to: propagation of totalitarian regimes, hate speech, racism, xenophobia,
> homophobia, transphobia, enbyphobia, queerphobia, queer exclusionism, sexism, misogyny, **ableism**, harassment,
> impersonation, encouraging self-harm and/or suicide, child pornography, broadly understood pedophilia advocacy,
> unlawful conduct, misinformation, sharing of someone else's personal data, spam, trolling, advertisement,
> copyright or trademark violations. We reserve the right to interpret as hate-speech all instances of non-obvious,
> concealed hate speech (eg. telling some people to “DNI” because of their queer identity,
> transphobic dogwhistles like “superstraight” or “semibisexual”, etc.).
