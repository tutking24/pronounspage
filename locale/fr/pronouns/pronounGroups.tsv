Normative forms	il,elle	It's worth mentioning that pronouns ≠ gender. One can still be nonbinary while using pronouns that are congruent with (or opposite to) their gender assigned at birth.
Normative-ish forms	ils,elles,on	Those pronouns have been in common use in normative French already, but recently they got a slightly different new usage: describing a single, specific person.
Neopronouns	al,ael,el,em,iel,ielle,ille,im,ol,ul,yel,yelle	Unlike the other pronouns, which are officially recognised as “grammatically correct”, albeit used in a different meaning than we're used to, neopronouns are novel. Not being included in dictionaries doesn't make them any worse, though!
