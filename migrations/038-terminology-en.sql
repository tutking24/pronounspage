In humans, these develop prenatally from two types of structures - Müllerian and Wolffian ducts - and their development is regulated by the {#hormonal=hormones} produced in the {#gonadal=gonads}. Testosterone produced in the testes causes the Wolffian ducts to develop into vas deferens and - together with the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH, also produced by the testes) - the Müllerian ducts to regress (they turn into vestigial organs - the prostatic utricle and the appendix testis). Low levels of testosterone and AMH (in foetuses with ovaries) let the Müllerian ducts develop freely and form the uterine tubes, the uterus, and the upper part of the vagina). Without testosterone, the Wolffian ducts partially regress (in all people they also turn into the ureters). A less typical development of internal genitals is also possible; their form also does not always "allign" with {#external=external genitals} or {#phenotypic=non-primary sex characteristics}. For example, in a person with a 46, XY {#chromosomal=karyotype} with complete androgen insensitivity, the Wolffian ducts regress (because the body does not react to testosterone), while the AMH causes the Müllerian ducts to regress (at the same time, the person''s external genitals and non-primary sex characteristics are feminine).

These develop prenatally from the urogenital sinus due to the influence of {#hormonal=hormones} produced in the {#gonadal=gonads}. The 5α-reductase enzyme (produced in various places, including gonads, skin, and the nervous system) allows the testosterone produced by testes to convert into dihydrotestosterone, thanks to which the penis and scrotum develop. In case of low level of testosterone (in a foetus with ovaries), the urogenital sinus develops into the clitoris and labia. A less typical development of external genitals and/or their being "not alligned" with the internal genitals is also possible (these are various types of being {intersex}). Atypical levels of estro- and androgens may cause a foetus to develop "ambiguous" genitals, e.g.: micropenis/enlarged clitoris, bifid scrotum/labial fusion, hypospadias (having the urethra place not on the top of the penis but in the middle or below it), undescended testes (this happens in persons with congenital adrenal hyperplasia or with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome). The shape of one''s genitals may also spontaneously change later in life. For example, in people with 46, XY {#chromosomal=karyotype} and congenital 5α-reductase deficiency, internal genitals are typically male (due to the effects of testosterone), but the lack of dihydrotestosterone leads to external genitals'' feminization (although they usually are not typically female). Later, durint puberty, other ways of producing dihydrotestosterone activate, and thanks to its effects the clitoris grows into a penis, ejaculation appears, the labia become a scrotum into which previously undescended testes move, phenotypical male characteristics appear, and the person''s {gender identity} (usually) becomes masculine (due to the apperance of external genitals, 46, XY people with 5α-reductase deficiensy are raised as girls) (based on {https://ksiegarnia.pwn.pl/Niebinarne-i-wielowarstwowe-pojecie-plci,761069627,p.html=Ziemińska 2018}: 16-17, 28-33).','gender','[]','','01EP5KZNBCCAD2024012HFMCR3',1),
