differentlyAnimated	Book	K. A. ^Cook	The Differently Animated and Queer Society	A short story from a collection called “Crooked Words” by K. A. Cook	2013	Pat couldn’t help a slight frown as ze got out of hir car. It wasn’t likely that someone was going to try and mug a zombie, but even so, the neighbourhood didn’t seem all that prosperous. There weren’t even too many cars around, just one down the other end of the street and a rusty bike chained to a light post.|Maybe ze shouldn’t have waited until ze’d be the last to arrive. What if everyone had come, decided that nobody was coming, and gone home already? What if ze was the only one to come at all?@This will be fine, Pat told hirself, in what felt like a ridiculous attempt to bolster hir courage. If ze had summoned up the courage for hir last job interview—and Pat thought ze would have gotten it despite being undead if ze felt remotely inclined to try and pass, something that annoyed hir job seeker support officer no end—then ze could summon up the courage to do this. This should be easier than a job interview!			01EP5KZNBCCAD2024012HFMCR3
prefaceTo	Book	Susan ^Stryker, Stephen Whittle	Preface to a reprint of Leslie Feinberg's pamphlet in “The Transgender Studies Reader”		2006	Leslie Feinberg, whose particular style of being transgender helped non-gender-specific pronouns like “s/he” and “hir” achieve a limited popularity over the past decade, must be considered a founding f gure of contemporary transgender studies. Hir influential pamphlet, reproduced below, took an older (and apolitical) term — transgender — and infused it with a radical new meaning. (p. 205)@Though hir particular theory of history has not attracted widespread support in transgender communities, hir work has gained a devoted and grateful following for the powerful way it calls upon transgender people to recover their historical legacy, and to harness that knowledge to the current struggle for a more just society.

buckingThe	Article	Levi C. R. Hord	Bucking the Linguistic Binary: Gender Neutral Language in English, Swedish, French, and German	Proceedings of Western Interdisciplinary Student Symposium on Language Research, Iss. 1, Vol. 3	2016	Speaking from hir unique gender position, Feinberg highlighted what ze called a “crisis of language” (Owen 1996) which often results in clumsy dual constructions such as s/he, and which would be solved by abandoning binary language altogether in favour of specific language to suit complex gender identities.
