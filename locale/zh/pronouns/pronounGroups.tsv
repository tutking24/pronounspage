Normative pronouns	他,她,她/妳	It's worth mentioning that pronouns ≠ gender. One can still be nonbinary while using pronouns that are congruent with (or opposite to) their gender assigned at birth. Additionally, while usually masculine now, “他” was originally a gender neutral pronoun and might still be used in this way.
Archaic and loaned pronouns	伊,佢,其,彼,渠	These pronouns were either used historically (for example in Classical Chinese) but are not part of normative Mandarin in modern times, or are borrowed from other Chinese languages.
Neopronouns	tā,X也,ㄊㄚ	Unlike the other pronouns, which are officially recognised as “grammatically correct” now or historically, neopronouns are novel. Instead of official Hanzi characters, they use Pinyin, Zhuyin or a combination of these and Hanzi characters.
Pronouns not normative for people	祂,祂/祢,它,牠	Those pronouns have been in common use in normative Mandarin already, but usually not for people – they have been used to refer to animals, things, or deities. But it does not mean that non-binary people can’t give them a new meaning!
