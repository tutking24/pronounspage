Normative forms	il,elle	It's worth mentioning that pronouns ≠ gender. One can still be nonbinary while using pronouns that are congruent with (or opposite to) their gender assigned at birth.
Neopronouns	al,ael,el,em,iel,ielle,ille,im,ol,ul,yel,yelle	Unlike the other pronouns, which are officially recognised as “grammatically correct”, albeit used in a different meaning than we're used to, neopronouns are novel. Not being included in dictionaries doesn't make them any worse, though! Some neoprouns' names are derived from the names of their creators.
