            Toki Pona uses just one 3rd person personal pronoun, “ona”, which is not gendered.
            Gender <em>may</em> be specified in rare cases, like when talking explicitly about gender identity
            or translating a text about a nonbinary character without erasing their identity expressed in the original version.
