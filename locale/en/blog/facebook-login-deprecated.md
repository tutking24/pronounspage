# We don't recommend using Facebook login

<small>2022-04-23 | [@andrea](/@andrea)</small>

We all know that Meta/Facebook is a company that couldn't give a shit about morality or users' privacy.
But did you know they're also unfriendly towards developers and try to impose their prudish, conservative views on independent websites?

This morning they've disabled two apps of mine whose whole purpose was simply to let people log in to a website using their Facebook account.
Nothing more, no actual dependency on Facebook, just the “log in with” button.

Why? One of them, [NakedAdventure](https://naked-adventure.eu/), is a map of nude beaches and contains small amounts of non-sexual nudity.
The other, [OurSong](https://oursong.eurovote.eu/), is a harmless game where people vote for their favourite songs
– but it's only accessible for members, so Facebook didn't like the fact that they cannot sniff around.
They have blocked the apps without notice, making independent websites inaccessible for some users on a whim.

If they think it's okay to suddenly cut people off other websites just because there was some non-sexual nudity present
or because they weren't able to snoop around, who knows if one day they won't block Pronouns.page because of the queer content?
After all, in countries like Russia distributing information about LGBTQ+ issues is already considered adult content.

Users of Pronouns.page seem to dislike Facebook anyway – only 2.76% of you has login with Facebook set up
(compared for example to 38,95% of people using login with Twitter).
But to those who use it as their primary login option –
**we strongly recommend setting up a different login method and ditching Facebook**.
