            Some people prefer not using any pronouns, instead being referred by name, initial,
            omitting pronouns with passive voice, or restructuring the sentence.

                    Because of the limitations of <language> grammar, or simply because they just prefer it that way,
                    many nonbinary people decide to simply use “he” ({/on=„on”}) or “she” ({/ona=„ona”})
                    – either the same as their gender assigned at birth or the opposite.
                    That doesn't make them any less nonbinary! Pronouns ≠ gender.
