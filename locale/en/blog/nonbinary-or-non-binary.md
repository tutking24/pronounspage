Is it spelled “nonbinary” or “non-binary”? 🤔

Well, it's simple: both spellings are correct.

For example, 
Wiktionary prefers [the version with a hyphen](https://web.archive.org/web/20221120023639/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/non-binary)
and [calls the other one an “alternative spelling”](https://web.archive.org/web/20220724013720/https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nonbinary),
while Merriam-Webster [has an entry for “nonbinary”](https://web.archive.org/web/20221119200219/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonbinary)
and redirects the hyphenated version to it.
At the moment Google shows 13.7M results for `"nonbinary"` and 38.9M results for `"non-binary"`.
[Wikipedia's article on the topic](https://web.archive.org/web/20221120072119/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender)
uses the hyphen in its title but there's plenty of occurrences of unhyphenated “nonbinary” throughout the text.
Basically: both spellings are being used widely and are correct.

And it's not like this word is special. [According to Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/non-#English)
prefix “non-” can be hyphenated or not in _all_ words that use it (“non-disclousure”, “nonviolent”, “non-stop”, …),
except when the root is capitalised (“non-Swedish”, …).

Personally, I prefer “nonbinary” because it's simpler, and _to me_ it sounds more like an identity in its own rights
rather than existing only in opposition to something (the hyphen gives too much emphasis on the "non" part, IMO).
But that's just me 🤷
