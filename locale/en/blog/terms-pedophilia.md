# Small change to Terms of Service – explicit ban of pedophilia advocacy

<small>2022-12-01 | [@andrea](/@andrea)</small>

We've always been banning profiles that advocate for pedophilia
(for example with so called “[MAP](https://www.adamhorowitzlaw.com/blog/2022/05/minor-attracted-persons-a-troubling-phrase/)” flags),
because we consider them to fall under “Content that might break the law or violate social norms”, which our [Terms of Service](/terms) forbid.

But after reading a ridiculous appeal from one owner of such account claiming that “pedophilia doesn't violate social norms”
we've decided that this point should be explicitly enumerated in our ToS.

The following wording (in bold) will come into effect on Jan 1st, 2023:

> It is forbidden to post on the Service any Content that might break the law or violate social norms,
> including but not limited to: propagation of totalitarian regimes, hate speech, racism, xenophobia,
> homophobia, transphobia, enbyphobia, queerphobia, queer exclusionism, sexism, misogyny, harassment,
> impersonation, encouraging self-harm and/or suicide, child pornography, **broadly understood pedophilia advocacy**,
> unlawful conduct, misinformation, sharing of someone else's personal data, spam, trolling, advertisement,
> copyright or trademark violations. We reserve the right to interpret as hate-speech all instances of non-obvious,
> concealed hate speech (eg. telling some people to “DNI” because of their queer identity,
> transphobic dogwhistles like “superstraight” or “semibisexual”, etc.).
