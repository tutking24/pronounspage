name	pronouns	description
Normative forms	han,hun	It's worth mentioning that pronouns ≠ gender. One can still be nonbinary while using pronouns that are congruent with (or opposite to) their gender assigned at birth.
Semi-normative	de,den	Those pronouns have been in common use in normative Norwegian already, but recently they got a slightly different new usage: describing a single, specific person. But remember that it/its pronouns have a history of transphobic use, so only use them for people who explicitly wish it.
Neopronouns	hen,hin	Unlike the other pronouns, which are officially recognised as “grammatically correct”, albeit used in a different meaning than we're used to, neopronouns are novel. Not being included in dictionaries doesn't make them any worse, though!
